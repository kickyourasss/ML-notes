Strategy for building a machine learning system has changed in the era of deep learning. For example, the way you split your data into train, development/dev(also called holdout cross-validation sets), and test sets, has changed in the era of deep learning

RNN: recurrent neural networks; LSTM models: long short term memory models

## What is Neural Network?

since house price cannot be negative, we make it 0 (rectified) when blue line starts to touch x-axis.

neuron implements the function curve in blue

family size, walkability, school quality are our interpretation of the outputs of first layer of neurons, it is not input!! 

In the implementation:

in neural network, give nodeâ‘  all the features and neural network will decide its representation.

## Supervised Learning with Neural Network

What model to use? Sequence data (like audio, language text):RNN; Image application: CNN; autonomous driving: custom hybrid NN

RNN is suitable for 1-dimensional sequence data.

### Structured Data and Unstructured Data

Structured Data: each of the feature has well-defined meaning

Unstructured Data: each of the feature do not has well-defined meaning

features of image: pixels values; features of text: individual words.
