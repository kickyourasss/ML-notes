Strategy for building a machine learning system has changed in the era of deep learning. For example, the way you split your data into train, development/dev(also called holdout cross-validation sets), and test sets, has changed in the era of deep learning

RNN: recurrent neural networks; LSTM models: long short term memory models

## What is Neural Network?

since house price cannot be negative, we make it 0 (rectified) when blue line starts to touch x-axis.

neuron implements the function curve in blue

family size, walkability, school quality are our interpretation of the outputs of first layer of neurons, it is not input!! 

In the implementation:

in neural network, give nodeâ‘  all the features and neural network will decide its representation.

## Supervised Learning with Neural Network

What model to use? Sequence data (like audio, language text):RNN; Image application: CNN; autonomous driving: custom hybrid NN

RNN is suitable for 1-dimensional sequence data.

### Structured Data and Unstructured Data

Structured Data: each of the feature has well-defined meaning

Unstructured Data: each of the feature do not has well-defined meaning

features of image: pixels values; features of text: individual words.

## Why is Deep Learning taking off?

If you have a large amount of data, make use of them to train a large model to make use of your data well.

In sigmoid function, in regionâ‘ â‘¡ï¼Œgradient is close to 0, in gradient descend, the parameters will be updated very slow (See [NNDL book page 81](https://nndl.github.io/nndl-book.pdf)).
In ReLU function, the gradient for all >0 input is 1, the gradient is less likely to shrink to 0 in gradient descent. So gradient descend will work faster using ReLU.

# Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
## Binary Classification

## Logistic Regression

when training the model, we need to leran w and b, for which prediction y has accurate prediction

## cost function

when define the loss as (half) square of error, the optimization may be nonconvex, so the gradient descent cannot find global optimum.

The loss function computes the error for a single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss functions of the entire training set. In training the logistic regression model, we try to find parameters W and B that minimize the overall cost function J, written at the bottom.

## gradient desce nt

We can use any initial point for initization, since the J is convex, it doesn't matter which initial value
Gradient descent starts at that initial point and then takes a step in the steepest downhill direction. After steps of gradient descent, it might end up in J being global optimum.

Derivatives of final output is computed in right-to-left way.

we will use da to mean dJ/da in python. 

In this class, in Python, we use **dvar** to represent **dFinalOutputVar/dvar** the derivative of a FinalOutputVariale w.r.t. intermediate quantities var.
